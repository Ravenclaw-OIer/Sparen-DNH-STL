# Sparen's Danmakufu Standard Library

This is a library of various data structures and other utilities for use in the Touhou Danmakufu ph3 language.

### Usage

To utilize these libraries, include them using the standard Danmakufu ph3 `#include` like so:

```
#include "./queue.dnh"
```

Each library must be included individually.

The libraries in this repository are all standalone and have no dependencies.

### Libraries

The following libraries are provided in this distribution:

* `queue.dnh`

### Running Unit Tests

Each of the unit tests (*_test.dnh) are Stage scripts that can be run by Danmakufu.

If one of the assertions fails, please note so on GitHub Issues. If there are compatability issues between this library and others, please let me know so that the libraries in this distribution can be adjusted.

### Contributing

This distribution is primarily maintained by myself. I welcome all suggestions and bug reports. If you would like to make a pull request, please feel free.
